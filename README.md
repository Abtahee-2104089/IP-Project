# IP-CUETClubSphere

Objectives
• To develop an online platform dedicated to managing and tracking club events and activities at CUET.
• To bridge the communication gap between clubs and students by centralizing announcements, event details, and updates.
• To enhance the efficiency of club management and member engagement through a structured digital interface.
• To reduce dependency on fragmented social media communication for event promotion and follow-up.
• To create a reliable system for event registration, reminders, and feedback within the university community.

Introduction
Clubs and co-curricular activities play a vital role in enriching student life at Chittagong University of Engineering Technology (CUET), where students enthusiastically engage in a wide range of events, from technical symposiums to cultural festivals. Despite this vibrant involvement, most clubs currently depend on social media platforms such as Facebook or WhatsApp to promote events, manage registrations, and share updates. While these platforms provide basic visibility, they lack the structure, traceability, and long-term data storage necessary for efficiently managing multiple club activities. This often results in overlapping events, communication breakdowns, and reduced student participation.
To address these challenges, our project, CUET ClubSphere, proposes a centralized and user-friendly web platform designed specifically to streamline and organize all club-related activities, ensuring better
coordination, improved visibility, and enhanced engagement across the university community.

Proposed Features of the Web Application
The key features planned for the CUET ClubSphere platform include:
• Event Dashboard: Display upcoming, ongoing, and past events with filters and search.
• Registration System: Allow students to sign up for events with confirmation notifications.
• Automated Reminders: Email or in-app alerts for registered participants.
• Club Pages: Dedicated sections for each club to post announcements, photos, and documents.
• Feedback Mechanism: Post-event forms to collect feedback and suggestions.
• Calendar Integration: A shared calendar to avoid event clashes and track academic schedules.
• Admin Panel: Access for faculty or club moderators to manage content, review stats, and export reports
